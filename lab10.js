//Task 1: What is API?
/* API: Application Programming Interface 
It is a middleware that allows two systems or applications to communicate through an agreed-upon protocol.
When one app needs data or services from another app, it sends a request to the server via API.
The server will respond with the requested information.

Example 
Google Map API: You open the restaurant. 
When a customer orders for delivery, you need to find their exact location.
You can request the address of your customer location sent to Google Maps via the Google Map API.
Google Maps will return the exact location of the customer's address.
This allows you to deliver the food to the right place.
